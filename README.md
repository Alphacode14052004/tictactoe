# TicTacToe UI in React

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the TicTacToe gameâ€™s user interface using React JS. It provides an intuitive and interactive front-end for users to play the classic game, allowing for two players to take turns in marking X and O on a 3x3 grid.

### Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Users can click on the cells to mark their moves, alternating between X and O.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Basic Game Logic Integration**: Allows players to see their moves in real-time, although it doesn't yet include win/loss logic.

### Project Structure
The project is built with React JS, using functional components for simplicity and ease of understanding.

- **Components**:
  - `Board`: Renders the 3x3 grid of the game.
  - `Square`: Represents each individual cell in the TicTacToe grid.
